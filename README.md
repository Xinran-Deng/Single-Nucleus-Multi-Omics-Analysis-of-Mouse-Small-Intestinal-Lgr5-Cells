# Single-Nucleus-Multi-Omics-Analysis-of-Mouse-Small-Intestinal-Lgr5-Cells
This is the code collection for analysing single-cell multi-omics data in the article entitled "Single-nucleus multi-omics analysis of mouse small-intestinal Lgr5+ cell populations reveals Foxa3-induced Paneth cell-lineage differentiation."

1. Import RNA+ATAC dual-modal single-cell sequencing data and perform quality control.
2. Perform dimensionality reduction and clustering using the Weighted Nearest Neighbor (WNN) algorithm.
3.Extract and reanalyse ISC cells.
4.Evaluate stemness of each cell subtype using CytoTrace2.
5. Conduct pseudo-time analysis with Monocle3.
6. Infer subtype-specific transcription factors for ISCs using Pyscenic.
7. Conduct consistency tests for gene expression and chromatin accessibility of candidate transcription factors for ISC subtypes.
